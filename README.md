# File Rotater/Switcher

This VSCode extension eases switching between related files with the single press of a button. You can cycle through related files with `F4` or `Shift + F4` for going backwards. It attempts to fetch next corresponding file in a rotation. First it checks current directory and afterwards it scans the whole workspace.

The extension has a degree of customization available, for example files, or whole directories, can be put into blacklists.

Default rotations support `Typescript`, `Javascript`, `C` and `C++` languages (for example rotating between header and source in `C/C++`)
