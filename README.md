# File Rotater/Switcher

This VSCode extension eases switching between related files with the single press of a button. You can cycle through related files witih `f2` or `shift + f2` for going backwards. 

The extension has a degree of customization availability, for example files or whole directories can be put into blacklists.

Default rotations support `Typescript`, `Javascript`, `C` and `C++` languages (for example rotating between header and source in `C/C++`)
